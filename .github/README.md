### PR Reference Types

- **`head`**  
  Fetches the actual content from the PR author‚Äôs branch (i.e., the original commit history without any merge operations).  
  This is equivalent to the original state of the PR branch, as if it were fetched directly from a fork or feature branch.

- **`merge`**  
  Fetches the result of GitHub‚Äôs pre-simulated merge of the PR into the target branch (e.g., `dev`).  
  This is a virtual merge commit automatically created by GitHub.  
  This commit only exists when the PR has no conflicts and is mergeable.
